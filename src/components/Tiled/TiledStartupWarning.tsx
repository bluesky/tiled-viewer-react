                You reached a Tiled server, but it just wasn't configured to talk to this client!
                You will need to configure the Tiled server and allow connections to this client. Try using the "TILED_ALLOW_ORIGINS" environment variable when starting the Tiled server,
                or if using a configuration file add an allow_origins entry with a list of urls you need to allow. See the Tiled documentation for more details. <a className="text-blue-500 underline" href="https://blueskyproject.io/tiled/reference/service-configuration.html#allow-origins">https://blueskyproject.io/tiled/reference/service-configuration.html#allow-origins</a>
